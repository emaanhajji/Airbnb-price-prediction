# Abstract

Airbnb is an online housing platform that provides users to list, discover, and book accommodations for their users all across the world. Hosts can offer their property spaces to guests for short or long periods of time. These accommodations differ from the typical hotel room because of the ability to live and witness the culture of living in the area of choosing. Airbnb’s listings offer a huge range of options ranging from community bedrooms to luxury housing, all in one platform. There is a peer-review system where guests can leave reviews after reservations are made. These reviews can often dictate how much owners can book/earn.The goal of this project is to apply Linear Regression on Airbnb dataset to predict the price based on the features of those courses (log_price, property_type, room_type, etc.). First, we start getting the data then start to clean them remove nulls values, fill null values and extract numbers from a string. After that, we started to explore the dataset and split the data into %60 train/%20validation, and %20 for the test. Finally, we tried different types of models to find the best one that fit our data which is XGB regression.

# Airbnb: An Overview

The data that will be used in this project has been extracted from kaggle website
https://www.kaggle.com/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction/code

# Data
The purpose of this project is to predict the prices of various accommodations listed in Airbnb that would benefit new hosts in determining the price range for their property.

# Algorithms

Divide the data into 3 sections: Training, Verification and Test.
•	 Data exploration and visualization.
•	 Data cleaning.
•	 Feature Engineering.
•	 Models: Creating xbg regression model for predict log price

# Tools

•	Python and Jupyter Notebook
•	Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting visuialization
•	Sklearn and Xgboost  for ML algorithms

# Communication

In addition to the slides and visuals presented, we will share our work on our Github accounts:
